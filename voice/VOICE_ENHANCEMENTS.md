## Testing

Run the test script to verify voice improvements:
```bash
python test_sage_voice.py
```

This will test all voice enhancements and verify the masculine, sage-like characteristics are working correctly.

## Technical Implementation

The voice system now uses a hierarchical approach (Coqui TTS disabled by user request):
1. **Edge TTS** (Highest quality) - Masculine voice selection with Indian English preference
2. **Pyttsx3** (Medium quality) - Enhanced male voice preference with sage-like characteristics
3. **Google TTS** (Fallback) - Basic functionality

**Note: Coqui TTS has been disabled by user request to reduce system load and dependencies.**

All implementations prioritize masculine voices and include the enhanced speech processing for sage-like delivery.
